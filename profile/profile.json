  "summary": "I'm a recent Computer Engineer Graduate from Ryerson, currently I have been looking for a position that fits my skill set. I was first introduced to the world of engineering and software development when I built my first computer in 2013, it gave an understanding that the parts within a computer have to work together for the computer to even turn on. I got more into software development in high school where I took the computer science course that was offered as an elective. That course taught me the fundamentals of the software development life cycle and object-oriented programming through Java. Other than that, at Ryerson I worked on multiple projects most notably my Capstone, where I created an AI personal Trainer with the use of Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. That application was able to track the movements of the user in real-time and compare it to an experts input and give the user real-time feedback on whether their work-out was bad, good, or amazing. In terms of skills, I believe myself to have great communication and interpersonal skills and my ability to learn new things on the fly."
