# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate from Ryerson University where I received my Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Computer Engineering. Throughout my education at Ryerson University, I developed strong analytical, problem solving and coding skills. Furthermore, I have a strong fundamental understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. I began to take interest in Data engineering in my final year at Ryerson University and quickly discovered that it includes all aspects of software development that I am passionate about. I developed multiple projects at Ryerson most notably an AI Personal Trainer that was able to collect data in real-time and give the user feedback on their workout routine. I believe myself to be a hardworking and highly motivated individual that enjoys being challenged when engaging with projects that require me to learn new programming languages and development techniques. I believe that clear communication streams and increased transparency can help organizations build highly efficient, confident and successful teams that are capable of creating the desired products for the consumers. Ultimately, I feel that my strong academic background in Computer and Data Engineering will enable me to excel and have a meaningful contribution to your team.
