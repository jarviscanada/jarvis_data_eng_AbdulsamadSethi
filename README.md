# Abdul Samad Sethi . Jarvis Consulting

I'm a recent Computer Engineer Graduate from Ryerson, currently I have been looking for a position that fits my skill set. I was first introduced to the world of engineering and software development when I built my first computer in 2013, it gave an understanding that the parts within a computer have to work together for the computer to even turn on. I got more into software development in high school where I took the computer science course that was offered as an elective. That course taught me the fundamentals of the software development life cycle and object-oriented programming through Java. Other than that, at Ryerson I worked on multiple projects most notably my Capstone, where I created an AI personal Trainer with the use of Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. That application was able to track the movements of the user in real-time and compare it to an experts input and give the user real-time feedback on whether their work-out was bad, good, or amazing. In terms of skills, I believe myself to have great communication and interpersonal skills and my ability to learn new things on the fly.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AbdulsamadSethi](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AbdulsamadSethi)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AbdulsamadSethi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a tool using bash scripts that gathers data on hardware specifications of a network of Linux Machines. This application monitors their resource usage in real time, and stores the data to a PSQL database maintained in a docker instance.

## Highlighted Projects
**AI Personal Trainer** [[GitHub](https://github.com/AbdulSamadSethi/Intelligent-Personal-Trainer)]: Designed an application where a user can follow along an exercise routine by a trainer on a video, and dynamically receive real-time feedback on quality of form as a score. Developed application's body tracking algorithm in Python using OpenCV and TensorFlow. Implemented neural networking and dynamic time warping to compute real-time user scoring metrics.

**Peer-to-Peer Application**: Developed an application that allows files and media to be exchanged among connected peer networks. Implemented UDP and TCP connections with an index server and peer networks using sockets in C. Integrated functionalities that allowed the user to upload and delete files that are shared with other connected peer networks via the index server.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Developed Data Engineering projects in Java with the use of other technologies such as Maven, Docker, Git, PSQL, and REST APIs. Collaborated with a team in daily Scrum meeting and bi-weekly sprint meetings to implement Agile development practices.

**Math Teaching Assistant (Co-op), St. Joseph Secondary School (2017)**: Responsible for assisting a secondary school teacher in delivering the grade 10 math curriculum to a class of 27 grade 10 students for over four months. Supported students by identifying their weakness and collaborating with students to improve their mathematical skills resulting in successful completion of the course.
